`haj` is a simple templating library that can either build DOM nodes (in the browser) or create HTML text from a JSON object.

Syntax is stolen from [`jquery-haml`](https://github.com/creationix/jquery-haml), and remains largely compatible, but `haj` is faster and doesn't require jQuery.

Documentation to come.
